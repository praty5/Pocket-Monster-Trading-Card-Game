1. Launch the program.
2. Choose whether to buy Pokémon trading cards or exit.
3. If you choose to buy, the program will deduct the required amount from your virtual money and provide you with a random Pokémon card.
4. View and manage your collection by choosing options from the menu.
5. Sell Pokémon cards to earn virtual money.
6. Save your Pokémon cards as a PDF for easy sharing.
7. Exit the program when you're done.

## Future Improvements
- Improve the logic and gameplay mechanics.
- Offer more choices and options for collecting and trading Pokémon cards.
- Enhance the user interface and graphics.
- Implement multiplayer functionality for trading with other players.

## Bugs/Issues
I am aware that using my program on Mac OS is making the ASCII art different/weird. Possible fix planned for later.

## Future Plans
In the far future, I aim to make the trading cards in the Pocket Monsters Trading Card Game as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This will allow players to truly own their digital Pokémon cards and trade them securely on blockchain platforms.

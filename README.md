# Pocket Monsters Trading Card Game (‚ö°üê≠)

## Description
The Pocket Monsters Trading Card Game (‚ö°üê≠) is a digital adaptation of the popular Pok√©mon trading card game. It offers a digital taste of collecting your favourite and rare Pok√©mon. Each virtual trading card has a different value (virtual) according to its rarity.

## Bugs/Issues
I am aware that using my program on Mac OS is making the ASCII art different/weird. Possible fix planned for later.


## Features
- Buy virtual Pok√©mon trading cards.
- Sell your Pok√©mon cards to earn virtual money.
- View and manage your collection of Pok√©mon cards.
- Save your Pok√©mon cards as PDF for easy sharing.
- Experience the excitement of opening packs and discovering rare Pok√©mon.
- Color-coded tiers for easy identification of card rarity.
- Custom made card backgrounds.
- Multiple card tiers, including Common, Rare, Super Rare, Legendary, and Mythic.

## Usage
1. Launch the program.
2. Choose whether to buy Pok√©mon trading cards or exit.
3. If you choose to buy, the program will deduct the required amount from your virtual money and provide you with a random Pok√©mon card.
4. View and manage your collection by choosing options from the menu.
5. Sell Pok√©mon cards to earn virtual money.
6. Save your Pok√©mon cards as a PDF for easy sharing.
7. Exit the program when you're done.

## Future Improvements
- Improve the logic and gameplay mechanics.
- Offer more choices and options for collecting and trading Pok√©mon cards.
- Enhance the user interface and graphics.
- Implement multiplayer functionality for trading with other players.

## Future Plans
In the far future, I aim to make the trading cards in the Pocket Monsters Trading Card Game as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This will allow players to truly own their digital Pok√©mon cards and trade them securely on blockchain platforms.
